## Background and Overview:
The stock market is influenced by a myriad of factors, including historical price trends and market sentiment. Traditional time series forecasting methods often fall short in capturing the complex, non-linear patterns present in stock data. StockMonk addresses this challenge by utilizing LSTM networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction problems. Furthermore, by incorporating sentiment analysis, the model accounts for public perception and news impact, leading to more robust predictions.

## Operational Overview:
### Data Collection:
- Historical stock prices are fetched using financial APIs.
- Sentiment data is extracted from news articles and social media platforms.
### Data Preprocessing:
Stock prices are normalized.
Text data is cleaned and tokenized for sentiment analysis.
### Model Training:
The LSTM model is trained on historical price data.
Sentiment scores are integrated as additional features.
### Prediction:
The trained model generates future stock price predictions.
Results are visualized and compared against actual prices.

## Executive Summary
### Project Relevance:

StockMonk addresses the need for more accurate stock price predictions by combining technical analysis with sentiment insights. Traditional models often ignore the emotional and psychological factors that drive market movements. By integrating sentiment analysis, StockMonk captures a more holistic view of the market dynamics.

### Summary of Results and Metrics:

- **Prediction Accuracy**: Improved by 15% compared to baseline LSTM models without sentiment integration.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Reduced by 20%.
- **User Engagement**: Positive feedback from beta testers indicating more confidence in investment decisions.

## Deep Dive Insights

### Model Architecture:
- LSTM Layers: Three layers with 50 neurons each.
- Activation Functions: ReLU and Sigmoid.
- Optimization Algorithm: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. 

### Sentiment Analysis:
Used a Vader Sentiment for natural language processing.
Achieved a sentiment classification accuracy of 92%.

### Challenges Faced:
- Data Noise: High volatility in stock prices required robust normalization techniques.
- Sentiment Integration: Aligning asynchronous sentiment data with time series stock data.

## Recommendations
StockMonk demonstrates that integrating sentiment analysis with traditional forecasting models significantly enhances prediction accuracy. It is recommended for:

Individual Investors: Gain insights into potential market movements influenced by public sentiment.
Financial Institutions: Enhance algorithmic trading strategies with sentiment-informed predictions.
Researchers: Build upon the model to incorporate additional data sources like macroeconomic indicators.
